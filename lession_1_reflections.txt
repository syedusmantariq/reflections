How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was easy!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

it would be pretty efficient.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

manually committing is easy and allows the personal to do every time he wants or when he thinks is important. automatically commiting provies periodic versions, but it si not easy to understand.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because on git there are mostly code or programming files which are inter related with each other.  while in google docs or others people mostly save files that are not related with each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

we can check it by viewing all the commit happened in every files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

it makes it me more efficient because it cn tell me every time when i did something wrong



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

i want to use git to record every change i made in my project
